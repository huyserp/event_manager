This project and the included documents are the end result of a tuorial designed to step though the process of reading in a CSV file to a program, and working with the data.

Comments have been left in as notes for my reference later.

Please note this tutorial has been adapted from The Turing School’s and Jump Start Lab’s Event Manager and updated to use GoogleCivic API
